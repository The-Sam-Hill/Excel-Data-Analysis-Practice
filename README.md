# Excel-Data-Analysis-Practice
This repository contains problems completed from a test using different Excel functions, tables, and tests.
In this Repo, I plan to practice different skills and refine my story-telling through data exploration in Excel and by using markdown files like this on in GitHub.
The three different test I will be using will cover these topics:

* Spreadsheet Functions to Organize Data
* Introduction to Filtering, Pivot Tables, and Charts
* Advanced Graphing and Charting

I will not be upload the entire test to this Repo. I will simply be using questions that required me to manipulate data on the spreadsheets and create formulas. Also, for naming convention any file with *Raw* in the file name is the **Original** file. All other files are the completed files. <br />
I hope you enjoy!

## Spreadsheet Functions to Organize Data
This is the first of three quizes that required me to complete a spreadsheet <br />

### Assuming you want the formula in H2 to always reference the cell directly to its left, correct the formula.  Once the formula is fixed, copy the formula down the column <br />

This question was requiring me to fix the formula located on cell `H2` from the `Store-Sales-2012 Raw` spreadsheet.
