# Excel-Data-Analysis-Practice
This repository contains problems completed from a test using different Excel functions, tables, and tests.
In this Repo, I plan to practice different skills and refine my story-telling through data exploration in Excel using markdown files like this on in GitHub.
The three different test I will be using will cover these topics:

* Spreadsheet Functions to Organize Data
* Introduction to Filtering, Pivot Tables, and Charts
* Advanced Graphing and Charting

I will be updating this file along the way to show my thought process throughout these three subjects and to practice basic documentation skills.
I hope you enjoy this insight!
